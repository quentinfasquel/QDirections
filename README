QDirections provides a service that calculates directions between locations (specified as an origin and a destination). It works with both addresses and coordinates.
The service use the Google Directions API : http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/directions/#DirectionsRequests

The results is a QRoute, made of several QRouteStep.

Some of the Google Directions API features are still missing :
- only one QRoute is returned while several are availables
- 'waypoints' cannot be specified
